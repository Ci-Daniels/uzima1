An improvement of the icms-qualia mobile application version.

## About
Responsive mobile application with the added feature of a deployed model of the qualia project. The Qualia project revolves around a remote monitoring system focused on cardiac disease patients. This application will help reduce mortality rates within the country and is set to span the global health community. Cardiovascular disease has been a leading cause of death both in Kenya and globally. 

ECG monitoring is usually done in hospitals using hospital-grade ECG machines. This means patients must go to the hospital whenever they require a scan. The current hospital ratings for monitoring are Ksh.1000/day. There I saw it prudent to come up with a system that will allow patients to receive the same kind of medical care remotely.
